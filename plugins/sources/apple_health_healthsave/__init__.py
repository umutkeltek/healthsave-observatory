"""Apple Health (HealthSave bridge) — first first-party Source plugin.

The HealthSave iOS app (App Store ID 6759843047) calls
``POST /api/apple/batch`` with HealthKit-shaped payloads. As of
Phase 6.1 the route handler in ``apps/api/server/api/ingest.py``
delegates the per-device write loop to this plugin via the SDK
loader (``plugin_sdk.discover()`` → entrypoint resolve →
``plugin.ingest(...)``). The route still owns: payload validation,
owner-id resolution, audit log_raw, the empty-batch branch, the
``RAW_LOG_ORPHANED`` error boundary, and the response shape.

Phase 6.1 made the plugin **Protocol-aware**: the caller injects an
``IngestStorage`` Protocol instance via ``payload["storage"]`` and the
plugin routes every device + ingest call through it. This preserves
the Phase 5C backend-swap seam (Timescale → InfluxDB) — the plugin
does NOT import ``storage.timescale.measurements`` for writes. Source
and backend are orthogonal axes that compose, not subsume.

Lifecycle (Phase 7-C will wire the rest):

  * ``setup(config)``   — no-op for this plugin.
  * ``ingest(payload)`` — one batch in, ``{accepted, rejected}`` out.
  * ``shutdown()``      — no-op.

Phase 7+ will move audit + counter responsibilities into the loader.

        ``payload`` MUST be the parsed BatchPayload-shaped dict — the
        same shape ``apps/api/server/api/ingest.py`` validates from
        ``await request.json()``. Returns
        ``{"accepted": N, "rejected": N, "deduped_in_batch": N, ...}``.
        ``rejected`` is the TRUE validation-failure count (missing/unparseable
        fields) reported by the storage writers via ``IngestWriteResult``;
        ``deduped_in_batch`` counts legitimate in-batch duplicate collapse
        (NOT a rejection). The ``INGEST_REJECTED`` Prometheus counter still
        fires per skip for operator alerting.

        Required keys in ``payload``:

          * ``storage`` (:class:`storage.ports.IngestStorage`) — Phase
            6.1 contract. The plugin dispatches every write through
            this Protocol instance. Tests inject a recording double;
            production injects ``PostgresIngestStorage``.
          * ``session`` — the open ``AsyncSession`` that the storage
            implementation expects (Postgres-typed in production).
          * ``device_id`` (int | str) — first-device id pre-resolved by
            the caller so the audit ``log_raw`` row gets the right
            device. Saves one ``get_or_create_device`` query per batch.
          * ``first_device_name`` (str) — name of that pre-resolved
            device. The plugin reuses ``device_id`` for matching
            ``device_name`` entries in ``sample_groups``.
          * ``metric`` (str) — the HealthKit metric name.
          * ``samples`` (list[dict]) — the parsed sample list.

        Optional:

          * ``owner_id`` (UUID) — defaults to ``DEFAULT_OWNER_ID``
            (the single-user sentinel that v1 + v2 share). The route
            resolves this from the ``X-User-Id`` header before calling
            the plugin, so production traffic always passes an explicit
            owner_id.
